# SWIFT-survey-2024-paper-data
 Metadata and plotting code for Postema *et al* 2025

This repository contains several Python code files and Jupyter notebooks necessary for analyzing the data and reproducing the figures included in "Thermal and rotational effects of giant impacts during terrestrial planet accretion" by A.N. Postema, S.J. Lock, and S.T. Stewart.

The contents of this repository are:
- Jupyter notebooks:
	- Manuscript_plots_only.ipynb: this notebook contains the code necessary to generate the figures included in the manuscript
	- makeplanet_SWIFT_share.ipynb: this notebook generates the planet profiles used as the initial components for impact simulations
	- SWIFT_orientation_clean.ipynb: this notebook takes in relaxed planets (originally generated by the makeplanet_SWIFT_share notebook) to orient them with the correct impact velocity and angle for each simulation
	- collisionmap.ipynb: adapted code for generating the impact outcome space from Stewart & Leinhardt 2012. This code has never been previously released in a Python format.
- Python files:
	- IE_gain_read.py: data extraction routines for pulling thermal information from SWIFT output hdf5 files
	- compare_disk_quantities_read.py: data extraction routines for pulling time series data from each snapshot of a given SWIFT simulation
	- melt_read.py: data extraction routine for pulling ANEOS phase information from SWIFT output hdf5 files
	- collisionmap.py: same base code as collisionmap.ipynb, but in a standard Python form instead of a notebook
	- HERCULES_structures.py: structured objects for extracting HERCULES simulation quantities from HERCULES output binary files
	- eostable.py: standard ANEOS eostable objects
- Spreadsheets:
	- Manuscript_data_table.csv: full extracted data from each simdata object, not cleaned of extraneous attributes
	- Manuscript_data_table_clean.csv: Cleaned data from each simulation object, with unused and extraneous attributes removed
	- Manuscript_data_table_clean.xls: Cleaned data in an Excel spreadsheet with some additional formatting
- environment_droplet.yml: YAML file for loading python environment to properly run the Jupyter notebooks
- Subdirectories:
	- data: all extracted data files used in the manuscript figure generation notebooks
	- makeplanets_data: data necessary to use the makeplanet_SWIFT_share.ipynb planet generation notebook
	- survey data: A small collection of output hdf5 files from SWIFT to show the structure of the simulation outputs, the full collection of simulation outputs is included in the Dryad repository (DOI: 10.5061/dryad.vdncjsz44)
	- Postema2024: A small collection of files used by collisionmap.ipynb necessary to create the collision maps used in this manuscript
	- woma: A version of the WoMa Python package with the EOS routine files modified to properly handle pyrolite material IDs. Download WoMa from https://github.com/srbonilla/WoMa and replace some of the files with the versions included here.
	- Old: old versions of figure plotting notebooks, includes a large amount of unused figures and old code, included for curiosity and archival purposes
